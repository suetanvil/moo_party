# moo.party

A website to make ASCII-art cows say things.  See it
[here](https://moo-party.neocities.org/).

## Overview

Up until now, making ASCII-art cows say things has required a certain
amount of technological skill.  One had to be proficient with the
command-line and the Perl package manager.

But no more.  With `moo.party` and a web browser, all of your
ASCII-cow-related needs will be met. (Note: assumes reasonable
ASCII-cow needs; cows will not cure diseases or speak prophecy unless
said prophecy was typed into the input box.)

## Features

* Supports dialogues between multiple cows.
* Nifty text-terminal look and feel.
* Shareable links; share your cow conversations with friends and acquaintances.
* Completely client-side; all of your information stays on your browser.
* Free and open-source under the MIT license.

## Contributors

`moo.party` is the work of Chris Reuter.  It was inspired by Tony
Monroe's [cowsay](https://github.com/tnalpgge/rank-amateur-cowsay)
which also provided the ASCII-art cow.
